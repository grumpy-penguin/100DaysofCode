This repo contains projects from my [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

I'm motivated to take part in this challenge, by recent work I've been doing with Ansible. But its more than that, I've been hacking along using Google for far too long and I need to get some structured knowledge and gain to some clear examples along the way.

Once, I've written and tested these projects, I apply formatting using the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatter. The README markdown documented is formatted with [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).

[Tip Calculator](day2/tip_calculator.py) a simple calculator demonstrating data types, number manipulation, mathmatical operators and f strings.

[Treasure Island](day3/treasure_island.py) a simple game demonstrating the use of control flow.

[Rock Paper Scissors](day4/rock_paper_scissors.py) a simple game to demonstate the use of randomness.

[Password Generator](day5/password_generator.py) a simple passwor dgenerator introducing loops with randomness. [Version 2](day5/password_generatorv2.py) is less verbose and makes use of more functions.

[Maze Escape](day6/maze_escape.py) introducing Python functions, on its own this project might make little sense, but put it into the context of [Reeborgs world maze challenge](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) and it will.

[Hangman](day7/hangman.py) day 7 consolidates the first weeks lessons, bringing together loops, conditionals, printing and random to create a game of hangman.

[Caesar Cipher](day8/caesar_cipher.py) day 8 a simple caesar cipher, expanding the use of functions.

You could also find my solutions to some of the code challenges at [repl.it](https://repl.it/@grumpypenguin1).
